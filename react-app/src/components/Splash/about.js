                We all have that person who knows you better 
                than you know yourself. We call them your Wing.
                 We also all know that dating is hard. 
                 Weeding through the posers to find your perfect someone is daunting.
                  So why not have your Wing do it for you? We all have the ability to fly,
                   but sometimes we need that extra push to leave the nest. 
                   Your Wing will sort through the all the Wrongs for you until they find your Right. 
                   All you have to do is show up for your first date. 
                   Winging it never felt so good.
